# Hofstadter's Butterfly

This project explores **Hofstadter‚Äôs butterfly**, a fractal energy spectrum that emerges when electrons move in a two-dimensional lattice under a magnetic field. The butterfly provides deep insight into **quantum Hall effects, topological invariants, and condensed matter systems**.

## üîç Overview
- Implemented numerical linear algebra methods in **Python** to compute the tight-binding Hamiltonian and corresponding energy spectrum for a 2D atomic lattice in the presence of a magnetic flux.
- Computed **Chern numbers** with Diophantine equations to analyze the topological nature of the energy bands.

## üìà Results
- Generated the beautiful fractal spectrum for square and hexagonal lattice strucutres
- Analyzed Hall conductances with colorful animations based on topological Chern numbers
- Produced a written report and presentation recognized for clarity and analysis.

## Future Work
- Debug/clarify Hamiltonians
- Extend to experimental context (using graphene)
- Develop more visualizations/interactive graphs
